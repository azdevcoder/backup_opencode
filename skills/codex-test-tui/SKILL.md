description: Guide for testing Codex TUI interactively

> Port of the Codex built-in skill `test-tui` from openai/codex (.codex/skills) for OpenCode. Directory and `name:` prefixed as `codex-test-tui`; body unchanged.

You can start and use Codex TUI to verify changes. 

Important notes:

Start interactively.
Always set RUST_LOG="trace" when starting the process.
Pass `-c log_dir=<some_temp_dir>` argument to have logs written to a specific directory to help with debugging.
When sending a test message programmatically, send text first, then send Enter in a separate write (do not send text + Enter in one burst).
Use `just codex` target to run - `just codex -c ...`
